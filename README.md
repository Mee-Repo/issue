This repository centralizes issue tracking for Mee

# Intro
Is it your first issue on GitHub? Please, spare 30 minutes of your time and these [references](##References) before you continue.

## Ready to report an issue?
Before submitting it, **make sure the problem has not been reported yet.** Duplicates cost valuable time from development, user experience and customer success.

If indeed it is something worth reporting, the next step is to open the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Mee-Repo/issue/issues) and classify as:
- **[Bug](###It's a Bug)**, when something broke or malfunctioned
- **[Enhancement](###It's an Enhancement)**, when you think of an improvement to something already working

### It's a Bug
Make sure you can explain the steps to reproduce the problem, then start creating an issue with the "Bug report" template. Observe that [styling with Markdown is supported](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). And mostly enforced by the template itself. Wanna see a good bug report example? [Check this](https://github.com/Mee-Repo/issue/issues/1).

About the template:
1. **Description** is a clear and concise description of what the bug is. If applicable, add screenshots to help explain the problem. Make sure what you have written down is put in a way that others can understand too. The reader will be in another context!
    1. **How to reproduce** will contain a step-by-step explanation about how to reproduce the issue. We recommend listing the steps with markdown. If necessary, include the URL, that text that was on your's [browser's address bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar) when the issue happened
    2. **Expected Behaviour** is a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
2. **Environment details** helps you communicating to other testers and developers some prerequisites to reproduce the issue, such as browser and device type. Most of this information is already generated by Mee for you, [on the browser console](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/232313848-How-to-open-the-developer-console).

## You're a developer and want to reference an issue?
Read this quote from [Creating an issues-only repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-an-issues-only-repository):

> For example, if you pushed a commit to the private repository's default branch with a message that read Fixes organization/public-repo#12, the issue would be closed, but only users with the proper permissions would see the cross-repository reference indicating the commit that closed the issue. Without the permissions, a reference still appears, but the details are omitted.
